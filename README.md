# UAM_ConceptDesign
This repository is about the concept design project in the International Summer Program of SNU, 'Multi-Disciplinary Design for Urban Air Mobility'

It is not my own work, but with my 2 of team members. Our team name was FLY.

It contains the simple code we used while designing our UAM as well as the report and the presentation materials.

We set motivation and then approximated the design paramters through the simple physics and mathematics.

Even though we took conservative strategy while calculating the manufacturing cost and operating cost, our mission profile was satisfied.

My professor's feedback was like 'The motivation is interesting but the L/D is set to be too optimisitc considering the structure'(it means that the number of the lift rotors, 12, is quite many so it would undermine the aerodynamic performance while cruising).

All the considerations can be found in our final report.
